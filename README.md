### :books: A English Lit graduate/:iphone: marketer turned coder
I've been interested in tech and development for quite a while but didn't know how to start. So I took the plunge and enrolled in a coding bootcamp with Northcoders! The bootcamp was a great and intense way to learn loads of super useful and relevant programming skills, frameworks and langauges, including:

![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-%23323330.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=%23F7DF1E) ![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/html5-%23E34F26.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=html5&logoColor=white) ![CSS3](https://img.shields.io/badge/css3-%231572B6.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=white) ![NPM](https://img.shields.io/badge/NPM-%23000000.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=npm&logoColor=white) ![Postgres](https://img.shields.io/badge/postgres-%23316192.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=postgresql&logoColor=white)	![NodeJS](https://img.shields.io/badge/node.js-6DA55F?style=for-the-badge&logo=node.js&logoColor=white) ![Express.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/express.js-%23404d59.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=express&logoColor=%2361DAFB) ![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/react-%2320232a.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=%2361DAFB) ![Jest](https://img.shields.io/badge/-jest-%23C21325?style=for-the-badge&logo=jest&logoColor=white) ![Heroku](https://img.shields.io/badge/heroku-%23430098.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=heroku&logoColor=white) ![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/github-%23121011.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white)  ![Insomnia](https://img.shields.io/badge/Insomnia-black?style=for-the-badge&logo=insomnia&logoColor=5849BE) ![Visual Studio Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Visual%20Studio%20Code-0078d7.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=visual-studio-code&logoColor=white)

I also learnt a number of key methodologies and industry practices, such as:
- Test Driven Development
- Wireframing
- Agile Working
- Pair Programming
- Mob Programming
- Accessibility Guidelines
- RegEx
- Axios

In my final group project with Northcoders, we worked on a local artist gallery website with potential to become a ecommerce platform. It's still a work in progress as the team are still enthusiastic to polish it off. We combined the knowledge we gained from the course, spiked a few new technologies and added a few more languages and frameworks/libraries to our arsenal:

![AWS](https://img.shields.io/badge/AWS-%23FF9900.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=amazon-aws&logoColor=white) ![Material UI](https://img.shields.io/badge/materialui-%230081CB.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=material-ui&logoColor=white) ![Bootstrap](https://img.shields.io/badge/bootstrap-%23563D7C.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=bootstrap&logoColor=white) ![Figma](https://img.shields.io/badge/figma-%23F24E1E.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=figma&logoColor=white) ![Adobe XD](https://img.shields.io/badge/Adobe%20XD-470137?style=for-the-badge&logo=Adobe%20XD&logoColor=#FF61F6)
